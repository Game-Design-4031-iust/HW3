## **🚀 Features**
1. **Car Movement Controls** 🎮  
   - Move and steer the car using keyboard inputs:
     - `W`: Move forward  
     - `S`: Brake / Move backward  
     - `A`: Turn left  
     - `D`: Turn right  

2. **Headlights** 💡  
   - Toggle the car's headlights on/off by pressing **G**.  
   - Realistic lighting effects for immersive gameplay.  

3. **Police Siren (Lights + Sound)** 🚨  
   - **Always-on flashing lights.**  
   - Press **Space** to:
